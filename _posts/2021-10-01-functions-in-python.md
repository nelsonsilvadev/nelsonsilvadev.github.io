In this post, you will learn how to work with functions so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- a function is an organized and reusable piece of code that is used to perform a single related action;
- functions provide better modularity and a high degree of code reuse.

```python
def personalData():
  print('Name: Nelson Silva')
  print('Age: 25')
  print('Nationality: Portuguese')

personalData()
personalData()
personalData()

'''
  Name: Nelson Silva
  Age: 25
  Nationality: Portuguese
  Name: Nelson Silva
  Age: 25
  Nationality: Portuguese
  Name: Nelson Silva
  Age: 25
  Nationality: Portuguese
'''
```
