In this post, you will learn how to work with integer, decimal (float), string and boolean variables so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- a variable is an object (a position located in the memory) that represents a value or an expression;
- in some of the existing programming languages it is necessary to define the variable type but not in Python;
- in Python the variable type is dynamic and not a fixed data type (it is automatically detected depending on its content);
- variable types: integer, decimal (float), string, boolean, lists, dictionaries and a few more;
- it should be noted that we are going to talk about lists and dictionaries in future posts.

```python
integer = 10
decimal = 10.5
string = 'I\'m a string.'
boolean = True

print('integer:', integer) # integer: 10
print('decimal:', decimal) # decimal: 10.5
print('string:', string) # string: I'm a string.
print('boolean:', boolean) # boolean: True
```
