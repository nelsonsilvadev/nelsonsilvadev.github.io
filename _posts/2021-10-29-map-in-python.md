In this post, you will learn how to work with map so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- the map function aims to map several data at once, returning a list referring to that same mapping.

```python
'''
  print(pow(2, 12))
  print(pow(3, 13))
  print(pow(4, 14))
'''

x = [2, 3, 4]
y = [12, 13, 14]

print(list(map(pow, x, y))) # [4096, 1594323, 268435456]
```
