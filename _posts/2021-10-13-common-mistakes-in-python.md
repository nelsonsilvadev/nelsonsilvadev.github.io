`NameError: name 'variable' is not defined` | When the displayed variable is not defined
`IndentationError: expected an indented block` | When indentation is not done correctly
`SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal` | When a string is not finalized (closed)
`SyntaxError: invalid syntax` | When a function is not closed correctly and not only

```python
variable = 'I\'m a string.'
print(variablee) # NameError: name 'variablee' is not defined

def function():
print('I\'m part of this function.') # IndentationError: expected an indented block

print('I\'m also a string.)' # SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

print('We are all a string.' # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
