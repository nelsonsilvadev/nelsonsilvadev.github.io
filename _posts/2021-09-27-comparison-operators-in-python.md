In this post, you will learn how to work with comparison operators so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

`==` | Equal
`!=` | Different
`>` | Greater
`<` | Smaller
`>=` | Greater and equal
`<=` | Smaller and equal
`and` | And
`or` | Or

```python
x = 10
y = 20

'''
  if x == y
  if x != y
  if x > y
  if x < y
  if x >= y
  if x <= y
  if x <= y and x == y:
'''
if x <= y or x == y:
  print('This condition is true.')
else:
  print('This condition is false.')

# This condition is true.
```
