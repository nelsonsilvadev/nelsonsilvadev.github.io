In this post, you will learn how to work with the `print()` function and with strings so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- the `print()` function prints its entire contents to the command line;
- a string is a set of characters (letters, numbers and/or symbols);
- all strings are initialized and ended with apostrophes ('string') or with quotation marks ("string");
- the escaped character is `\` and aims to make the character that follows part of the string.

```python
print('We are using the print() function and I am a string.')
print("I'm still a string.")
print('Maria said that Miguel was "sick".') # Maria said that Miguel was "sick".
print('I\'m writing in English.') # I'm writing in English.
print('Caffeine', 'Algorithm') # Caffeine Algorithm
```
