In this post, you will learn how to work with arithmetic operators so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

`+` | Addition
`-` | Subtraction
`*` | Multiplication
`/` | Division
`%` | Rest
`**` | Exponent

```python
print('Addition:', 10 + 10) # 20
print('Subtraction:', 10.5 - 5.5 - 4.5) # 0.5
print('Multiplication:', -10 * -2) # -20
print('Division:', 10 / 10) # 1.0
print('Rest:', 8 % 2) # 0
print('Exponent:', 2 ** 5) # 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32
```
