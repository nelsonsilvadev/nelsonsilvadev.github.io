- access to complete projects entirely developed in live sessions.

#### What has changed?

- videos with better quality;
  - theoretical content also presented on video;
  - content correctly visible;
  - quality improvement (sound included);
  - animations.
- text posts (both in Portuguese and in English);
- code fully shared in relation to what was developed;
