In this post, you will learn how to work with return so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- the return aims to return something from a function so that when calling this function, you have access to the returned value.

```python
def addition():
  result = 0

  for number in range(1, 11):
    result += number

  return result

print('Addition result:', addition()) # Addition result: 55
```
