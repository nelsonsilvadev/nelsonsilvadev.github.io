In this post, you will learn how to work with decisions (if, elif and else) so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

```python
'''
  (if) condition is true:
    the code inside the if is executed
  (elif) condition is true (elif only occurs when the if condition is false):
    the code inside the elif is executed
  (else) without condition (only occurs when the if/elif conditions are false):
    the code inside the else is executed
'''

x = 30

if x == 10:
   print('The value of x is equal to 10.')
elif x == 20:
   print('The value of x is equal to 20.')
else:
   print('The value of x is different from 10 and 20.')

# The value of x is different from 10 and 20.
```
