In this post, you will learn how to work with the for loop so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- a cycle allows executing an instruction or a set of instructions several times;
- the for loop iterates depending on the items in a sequence (a list, a string or a given range).

```python
organization = 'Caffeine Algorithm'
colors = ['Blue', 'Green', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Orange']

'''
  for character in organization:
    print('Character:', character)

  for color in colors:
    print('Color:', color)
'''

for number in range(1, 11):
  print('Number:', number)

'''
  Number: 1
  Number: 2
  Number: 3
  Number: 4
  Number: 5
  Number: 6
  Number: 7
  Number: 8
  Number: 9
  Number: 10
'''
```
