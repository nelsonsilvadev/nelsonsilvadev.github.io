In this post, you will learn how to work with exceptions so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a piece of code that interrupts its normal flow of instructions;
- in short, an exception represents an error.

`IOError` | When an error occurs related to file handling

```python
try:
   readFile = open('File-Write-and-Read.txt', 'r')
   print(readFile.read())
except IOError:
   print('The file does not exist and/or its contents cannot be read.')
else:
   print('The file was read successfully.')
   readFile.close()

print('I know there was an error, however, my content is still displayed on the command line.')
```
