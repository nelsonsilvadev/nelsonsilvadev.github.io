In this post, you will learn how to work with comments so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

The comments (of one or multiple lines) are used to comment everything that is necessary for someone else to understand our code.

```java
package com.caffeinealgorithm.programminginjava;

public class Comments {
  public void Run() {
    // I am a comment.

    System.out.println("I am a string.");

    /*
      I am also a comment.
      I am part of this same comment.
      I continue to be part of it.
    */

    System.out.println("I continue to be a string.");
  }
}
```
