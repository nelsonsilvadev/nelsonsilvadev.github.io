In this post, you will learn how to work with something more about strings so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

`\n` | New line
`\t` | New tab (indentation)
`len(variable)` | Returns the number of characters (in case of a string)
`upper()` | Turns all letters present in the string into uppercase letters
`lower()` | Turns all letters present in the string into lowercase letters

```python
string = 'I\'m\n\ta string.'

print(len(string)) # 14
print(string.upper())

'''
  I'M
    A STRING.
'''

print(string.lower())

'''
  I'm
    a string.
'''
```
