In this post, you will learn how to work with the Process class so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- this class provides access to local/remote processes and allows you to start/stop system processes.

`Process.start()` | A certain process is started
`Process.isAlive()` | Checks whether the process data is running or not
`Process.destroy()` | Termination given process
`Thread.sleep()` | Suspends the current thread for the specified time (time in milliseconds)

```java
package com.caffeinealgorithm.programminginjava;

public class ProcessClass {
  private Process process;

  public void Run() {
    try {
      process = new ProcessBuilder("notepad.exe").start();
    }
    catch (Exception exception) {
      System.out.println(exception);
    }

    try {
      if (process.isAlive()) {
        System.out.println("The \"notepad.exe\" process is running and it will finish in about three seconds.");
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        process.destroy();
      }
    }
    catch (InterruptedException exception) {
      System.out.println(exception);
    }
  }
}

// The "notepad.exe" process is running and it will finish in about three seconds.
```
