In this post, you will learn how to work with assignment operators so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

`a += 3` | `a = a + 3`
`b -= 2` | `b = b - 2`
`c *= 2` | `c = c * 2`
`d /= 2` | `d = d / 2`
`e %= 2` | `e = e % 2`
`f **= 2` | `f = f ** 2`

```python
x = 2

x += 3
print('x = x + 3:', x) # x = x + 3: 5

x -= 2
print('x = x - 2:', x) # x = x - 2: 3

x *= 2
print('x = x * 2:', x) # x = x * 2: 6

x /= 2
print('x = x / 2:', x) # x = x / 2: 3

x %= 3
print('x = x % 3:', x) # x = x % 3: 0

x **= 2
print('x = x ** 2:', x) # x = x ** 2: 0
```
