Well, Go is a compiled programming language created by a team of engineers at Google in 2007, and in 2009 it became an open source language and later, in 2010, it was used by developers outside of Google. It is also important to say that this language was created due to being dissatisfied with the characteristics of C and other available languages ​​that do not offer necessary resources for some company projects.

Some important features about the language that we're going to learn in this series are:

- the low use of special characters (which makes the language very similar to pseudocode;
- the fact that it is modular, has encapsulation and polymorphism;
- the use of a garbage collector (which serves to clean up everything that is not being needed), so that it automatically manages memory usage.

It is also important to say that Go is a programming language that essentially supports the paradigm regarding imperative programming and not to forget that such a language can mostly be used to work with networks, web servers, automation tools, command line tools and to produce sustainable code.

- installation of Go;
- installation of Visual Studio Code (optional).
