Well, Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 (this being a Dutch mathematician and programmer), and basically, the two goals of this same language are productivity and readability, which in other words, be able to produce code that is efficient and easy to maintain quickly.

Some important language features that we're going to learn in this series are:

- the low use of special characters (which makes the language very similar to pseudocode);
- the use of indentation to mark blocks (pieces of code);
- the almost no use of keywords aimed at compilation;
- the use of a garbage collector (which serves to clean up everything that is not being needed), so that you can automatically manage memory usage.

It is also important to say that Python is a programming language that supports multiple paradigms, including object-oriented programming, imperative programming, and functional programming.

Do not forget that such language can be used for data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, building applications, websites and so on.
