In this post, you will learn how to work with the `input()` function so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- the `input()` function has as main objective to "extract" information given by the user;
- in short, this same function serves to increase interaction with it.

```python
firstName = input('Enter your first name: ')
lastName = input('Enter your last name: ')
age = input('Enter your age: ')

print('First name:', firstName)
print('Last name:', lastName)
print('Age:', age)
```
