In this post, you will learn how to work with lists so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- a list is an ordered set of values, where each value is identified by an index;
- the values that make up a list are called elements.

```python
list = ['I\'m a string.', 10, 10.5, True, ['A', 'B', 'C']]

list[0] = 'I\'m still a string anyway.'

print('Slicing:', list[2:3]) # Slicing: [10.5]
print('Contents of list:', list)
print('Number of list elements:', len(list[4])) # Number of list elements: 3
```
