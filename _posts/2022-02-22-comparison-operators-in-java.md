In this post, you will learn how to work with comparison operators so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

`==` | Equal
`!=` | Different
`>` | Greater
`<` | Smaller
`>=` | Greater and equal
`<=` | Smaller and equal
`&&` | And
`||` | Or

```java
package com.caffeinealgorithm.programminginjava;

public class ComparisonOperators {
  public void Run() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;

    if (x <= y || x == y)
      System.out.println("This condition is true.");
    else
      System.out.println("This condition is false.");
  }
}

// This condition is true.
```
