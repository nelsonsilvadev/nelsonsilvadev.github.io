An IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which translated means, Integrated Development Environment, is a program that integrates the various tools needed for software development helping this entire process.

- in short, its main function is to help the programmer edit the code that will be used to create your application, and then, yes, compile it;
- such compilation is done through the compiler which is the program that analyzes and generates the executable of the code that was developed.

Now talking about our programming language, C# was created by Microsoft in 2000 (as part of the .NET platform architecture), and basically, it was designed to be simple, modern, generalist and object-oriented (and of course, there are numerous similarities to other languages ​​such as Java and/or Visual Basic).

Some important features about the language that we're going to learn in this series are:

- completely object-oriented, since everything is an object and any variable must be part of a class;
- the fact that it is strongly typed (which helps to avoid mishandling errors and incorrect assignments;
- the use of a semicolon to denote the end of a statement is not at all optional as in the Python programming language;
- the memory control regarding the developed application is not managed by the programmers, but by the .NET platform (which greatly reduces the possibility of errors due to freeing and memory allocation).

- installation of Visual Studio.
