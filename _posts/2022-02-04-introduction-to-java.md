An IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which translated means, Integrated Development Environment, is a program that integrates the various tools needed for software development helping this entire process.

- in short, its main function is to help the programmer to edit the code that will be used to create your application, and then, yes, to complicate it;
- such compilation is done through the compiler which is the program that analyzes and generates the executable of the code that was developed.

Speaking now about our programming language, Java was created by a team of programmers led by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995 (however, its development began in 1991). Of course, it is important to say that in 2008 Java was acquired by the company Oracle Corporation. This same language was designed to be simple, modern, generalist and object-oriented (and of course, there are numerous similarities to other languages ​​like C# and/or Visual Basic).

Some important features about this language that we're going to learn in this series are:

- completely object-oriented, since everything is an object and any variable must be part of a class;
- the fact that it is strongly typed (which helps to avoid mishandling errors and incorrect assignments);
- the use of a semicolon to denote the end of a statement is not at all optional as in the Python programming language;
- the memory control regarding the developed application is not managed by the programmer, but by the Java garbage collectors (which greatly reduces the possibility of errors due to memory release and allocation).

- installation of the JDK, which means, Java Development Kit and is necessary for those who want to develop applications and this same kit contains everything that is also necessary to program in Java and has the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) that is used in itself to run the applications then developed in Java;
- installation of IntelliJ IDEA.
