In this post, you will learn how to work with arguments so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- arguments are like variables that receive their values (their content) when the function is called;
- these same arguments are considered to be local variables because they only exist inside the function;
- local variables are discarded when returning to the calling point.

```python
def personalData(name, age, nationality):
  print('Name:', name)
  print('Age:', age)
  print('Nationality:', nationality)

personalData('Nelson Silva', 25, 'Portuguese')
personalData('Larissa Fernandes', 37, 'Brazilian')

'''
  Name: Nelson Silva
  Age: 25
  Nationality: Portuguese
  Name: Larissa Fernandes
  Age: 37
  Nationality: Brazilian
'''
```
