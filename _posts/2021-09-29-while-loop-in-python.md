In this post, you will learn how to work with the while loop so that you can use that same knowledge and thus evolve.

- a cycle allows executing an instruction or a set of instructions several times;
- the while loop iterates according to a certain condition (it must be true).

```python
'''
  while True:
    print('We are facing an infinite cycle.')
'''

count = 1

while count <= 10:
  print('Interaction number:', count)
  count += 1

'''
  Interaction number: 1
  Interaction number: 2
  Interaction number: 3
  Interaction number: 4
  Interaction number: 5
  Interaction number: 6
  Interaction number: 7
  Interaction number: 8
  Interaction number: 9
  Interaction number: 10
'''
```
